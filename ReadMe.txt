Intro:

	This game was created within the BYOND (http://byond.com) platform over the course of the
	CybPunk 2014 Game Jam. All assets belong to Zynkco (with the exception of some music tracks.)
	
Controls:

	[W,A,S,D] are your movement keys.
	[Space] to jump. It also continues dialog sections.
	[Q] is your QuickSlot Circle. Hold to bring it up.
	[I] is your inventory.
	
Problems running the Game?	
	
	The game sometimes takes 10 seconds or so to load - it's a problem in Byond, just wait it out.
	Make sure your Antivirus isn't blocking the byondexe. Sandbox mode sometimes conflicts.
	If any problems come up please email mechanios@gmail.com
	Byond is still building upon it's standalone release (instead of installing the whole engine.) 
	There's bound to be problems. I'd wager my credits on it.
